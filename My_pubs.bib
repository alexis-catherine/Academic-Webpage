	abstract = {Ongoing stewardship is required to keep data collections and archives in existence. Scientific data collections may face a range of risk factors that could hinder, constrain, or limit current or future data use. Identifying such risk factors to data use is a key step in preventing or minimizing data loss. This paper presents an analysis of data risk factors that scientific data collections may face, and a data risk assessment matrix to support data risk assessments to help ameliorate those risks. The goals of this work are to inform and enable effective data risk assessment by: a) individuals and organizations who manage data collections, and b) individuals and organizations who want to help to reduce the risks associated with data preservation and stewardship. The data risk assessment framework presented in this paper provides a platform from which risk assessments can begin, and a reference point for discussions of data stewardship resource allocations and priorities.},

	abstract = {"The Mohonk Preserve's Daniel Smiley Research Center has been monitoring species occupancy, reproductive success, and water quality of 11 vernal pools (Ski Loop, Bonticou, Terrace, Long Woodland Pool, Long Woodland Swamp, Oakwood, Sleepy Hollow, Hermits, North Mud Pond, Canaan, and Talus) on the Preserve each spring from April 1931 to May 2019 (present). This project aims to document changes in the reproductive behavior and phenology of amphibians and allow research access to historical, longitudinal records. The dataset is a paired record of amphibian occurence with environmental indicators spanning nearly 90 years of data collection. The dataset includes environmental conditions for the 730 sampling events associated with the species occurences with complete coverage air temperature and precipitation records and partial coverage for a variety of other weather and water quality measures. Species occurence data collection has included species identification and counts of live and dead adults, mated pairs, spermatophores, egg masses, juveniles, and tadpoles counts as well as a record of the level of frog calling. Weather conditions including precipitation, sky and wind codes; and water quality measurements including water temperature, pH, and depth. Collection of data was sporadic from 1931 - 1991 but has been collected consistently from 1991 to present. We also began monitoring dissolved oxygen, nitrate concentrations, and conductivity of the vernal pools using a YSI Sonde Professional Plus Instrument and turbidity using a turbidity tube in February 2018. The data collection is ongoing, as are digitization efforts, and the data package will receive periodic updates."},

	abstract = {The mission of the Mohonk Preserve is to protect the Shawangunk Mountains region and inspire people to care for, enjoy, and explore their natural world. Among these 8,000 acres are the vernal pools, permanent springs, tributaries, Humpo Marsh, and the Humpo Kill, and parts of the Kleine Kill and Coxing Kill watersheds within the Hudson River Drainage Basin. Not only are the areas around the Shawangunks established habitats for New York State (NYS) protected species, including an Audubon-designated Important Bird Area, but the watershed also encapsulates more than one agricultural land use area, as well as Rondout Creek, which is an important waterway for the New York City water supply. A conservation plan must be implemented in these areas in particular, keeping in line with the Mohonk Preserves goal to conserve the Shawangunk region for both humans and the greater ecosystem within it. Recognizing the immediate and long-term conservation needs of the streams in this region by employing volunteer data collection will be a catalyst to the Preserves understanding of which environmental threats of this area should be prioritized. The StreamWatch citizen science program will be the newest addition to an array of volunteer research areas, which include collection of weather data, phenology observations, monitoring of peregrine falcon breeding activities, and monitoring of fall hawk migration. Using concise stream monitoring protocol designed for volunteer safety and maximum data accuracy, StreamWatch will evaluate water quality using an array of parameters. Following thorough observation and assessment (which will include analyzing appearance and smell of the water, shape of the stream, canopy cover, nearby land uses, recent weather, and presence of riparian vegetation including invasive species) water quality will be evaluated by means of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity measurements, in addition to a macroinvertebrate count. Width and depth will also be measured, being indirect contributors to stream quality. The StreamWatch protocol aims to follow a simple procedure that will yield accurate and useful data from all of these aforementioned parameters in order to confirm relevant needs for riparian buffers, changes in nearby agricultural practices (some of which directly affect portions of the watershed), protection against invasive species, and any other potential solutions to problems these watersheds may be afflicted by presently or in the future. Volunteer involvement in this stream water sampling process will encourage the concept of stewardship among visitors of the preserve, while simultaneously honing in on and pursuing various conservation goals.},

	abstract = {Advancements in molecular genetics have revealed that hybridization may be common among plants, animals, and fungi, playing a role in evolutionary dynamics and speciation. While hybridization has been well-documented in pathogenic fungi, the effects of these processes on speciation in fungal lineages with different life histories and ecological niches are largely unexplored. Here we investigated the potential influence of hybridization on the emergence of morphologically and reproductively distinct asexual lichens. We focused on vagrant forms (growing obligately unattached to substrates) within a clade of rock-dwelling, sexually reproducing species in the Rhizoplaca melanophthalma (Lecanoraceae, Ascomycota) species complex. We used phylogenomic data from both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes to infer evolutionary relationships and potential patterns of introgression. We observed multiple instances of discordance between the mitochondrial and nuclear trees, including the clade comprising the asexual vagrant species R. arbuscula, R. haydenii, R. idahoensis, and a closely related rock-dwelling lineage. Despite well-supported phylogenies, we recovered strong evidence of a reticulated evolutionary history using a network approach that incorporates both incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization. These data suggest that the rock-dwelling western North American subalpine endemic R. shushanii is potentially the result of a hybrid speciation event, and introgression may have also played a role in other taxa, including vagrant species R. arbuscula, R. haydenii and R. idahoensis. We discuss the potential roles of hybridization in terms of generating asexuality and novel morphological traits in lichens. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for additional study of reticulate phylogenies when investigating species boundaries and evolutionary history, even in cases with well-supported topologies inferred from genome-scale data.},
